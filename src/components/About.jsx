                <p className='w-full'>I have done engineering in mechanical (2017-21) branch so always had hunger for logic,started learning Web Development from 2021, though I have 1 year+ experience in an automotive industry but my interest in coding pulled me back in web development and just after quiting my job I joined "JSPIDERS" back then I was in absolute love with Javascript and all ES-6 methods then I started learning Reactjs and with function based componets writing "npm start" in terminal became one of the my favourite thing to do. I have well maintained my git repos which I update regularly. </p>
                <br />
                <p className='w-full' >Right now I am looking for an "Internship" or "entry level job" as a Frontend web Developer with major skils in Reactjs where I can learn and grow, with 1 year of industry experience I know about work-space culture and I am always ready to walk an extra mile to make things easier with my code and communication.I have made 20+ small to large level projects using pure javascript and Reactjs most of them made up to my github repos in which I wrote custom css and used "json server","render.com",react-routers,"getforms","firebase",bootstrap,"tailwind".Now days I am learning Redux and nodejs by doing projects. please do check my Portfolio mentioned below. </p>
